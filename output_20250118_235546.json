It outlines the objectives for enhancing CSI feedback, including improving the trade-off between performance and complexity, and addressing inter-vendor training collaboration issues. The document presents detailed evaluations of temporal-spatial-frequency domain compression, agreements on evaluation assumptions, and the generation of datasets for the UMa scenario. It also discusses the use of Transformer architecture for compressing SVD-based precoder inputs and presents results comparing LSTM and MHA architectures. The document concludes with observations on inter-vendor collaboration, emphasizing the need for standardized signaling and the potential impacts of various options on performance and complexity. Overall, it serves as a comprehensive overview of the current state and future directions for AI/ML applications in CSI compression.",
