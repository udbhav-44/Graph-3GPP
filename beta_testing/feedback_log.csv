**answer**:
To deactivate on-demand SSB (Synchronization Signal Block) transmission from a User Equipment (UE) perspective, the following options are supported, as outlined in the documents:

1. **Explicit Indication via MAC-CE**: An explicit indication of deactivation for on-demand SSB can be sent through a MAC Control Element (MAC-CE) for on-demand SSB transmission indication (Option 1) (R1-2410271, p. 1; R1-2409107, p. 4).

2. **Explicit Indication via RRC**: An explicit indication of deactivation can also be provided via Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling (Option 1A) (R1-2410271, p. 1).

3. **Configuration of Number of Bursts**: The network can configure or indicate the number \( N \) of on-demand SSB bursts to be transmitted after on-demand SSB is indicated (Option 2) (R1-2410271, p. 1; R1-2409107, p. 4).

4. **Configuration of Duration**: The network may configure or indicate the duration of the on-demand SSB transmission window (Option 3) (R1-2410271, p. 1; R1-2409107, p. 4).

5. **Deactivation upon SCell Deactivation**: On-demand SSB transmission can be deactivated when the UE receives a SCell deactivation MAC-CE for the activated SCell (Option 4) (R1-2410271, p. 1; R1-2409107, p. 4).

6. **Deactivation upon Timer Expiry**: On-demand SSB transmission can also be deactivated when the timer for SCell deactivation expires (Option 4A) (R1-2410271, p. 1; R1-2409107, p. 4).

7. **Deactivation upon SCell Activation Completion**: On-demand SSB transmission can be deactivated when SCell activation is completed (Option 5) (R1-2410271, p. 1; R1-2409107, p. 4).

8. **DCI-Based Indication**: An explicit indication of deactivation for on-demand SSB can be provided via group-common DCI (Option 6) (R1-2410271, p. 1; R1-2409107, p. 4).

These options provide flexibility in managing on-demand SSB transmission and ensure that the network can effectively control the signaling based on the operational needs. The need for explicit signaling (Options 1, 1A, and 6) versus implicit signaling (Options 4 and 4A) has been a topic of discussion, with some stakeholders advocating for the former to reduce ambiguity in operation (R1-2410271, p. 3)."

**answer**:
The context provided includes various documents related to the 3GPP specifications, particularly focusing on the Demodulation Reference Signals (DMRS) and their enhancements in different release versions. 

1. **Mapping to Physical Resources**: According to R1-2408981.docx, the mapping of the DMRS sequence to physical resources is contingent on the configuration type specified by the higher-layer parameter `dmrs-Type`. The document states, ""The UE shall assume the PDSCH DM-RS being mapped to physical resources according to configuration type 1 or configuration type 2 as given by the higher-layer parameter dmrs-Type"" (Page 2). This indicates that the DMRS mapping is flexible and can adapt based on the configuration type, which is critical for ensuring accurate demodulation in varying network conditions.

2. **Enhancements and Corrections**: The document R1-2408981 also discusses the enhancements to DMRS in Release 18, particularly the exclusion of certain DCI formats (1_0, 4_0, 4_1, and 0_0) from using Rel-18 DMRS ports when the higher-layer parameter `dmrs-TypeEnh` is configured. This change aims to eliminate ambiguity regarding the use of enhanced DMRS types when scheduled with different DCI formats (Page 1).

3. **Sequence Generation**: In R1-2405836.docx, the sequence generation for DMRS is defined, emphasizing the importance of the pseudo-random sequence initialized with specific parameters. The document states, ""The pseudo-random sequence generator shall be initialized with..."" indicating a structured approach to generating sequences that are essential for reliable communication (Page N/A).

4. **Technical Consistency**: There is a clear emphasis on maintaining consistency between the training and inference phases in AI/ML-based models, as highlighted in R1-2406353.DOCX. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that the receiver (Rx) information aligns during both phases, which is vital for effective beam management and signal processing (Page 6).

5. **Comparative Analysis**: The changes proposed in R1-2408981 regarding DMRS enhancements and the mapping strategies reflect a significant evolution in the handling of reference signals. The exclusion of certain DCI formats from using enhanced DMRS ports is a strategic move to streamline operations and reduce potential conflicts in signal processing. This contrasts with earlier versions where such exclusions were not clearly defined, leading to ambiguity.

In summary, the documents collectively highlight the ongoing enhancements and corrections to the DMRS specifications, emphasizing the importance of configuration types, sequence generation, and the need for clarity in signal processing to support advanced communication technologies. The references to specific clauses and configurations underscore the technical depth and precision required in these standards."

**answer**:
The concept of Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS) and Wake-Up Receiver (LP-WUR) is being developed to enhance the efficiency of communication in various modes, particularly in IDLE/INACTIVE and CONNECTED modes. The discussions and proposals surrounding LP-WUS and LP-WUR are documented in several contributions, notably R1-2400640, R1-2400123, R1-2407041, and R1-2400592.

### Key Aspects of LP-WUS and LP-WUR:

1. **Design and Functionality**:
   - The LP-WUS is designed to enable efficient wake-up of devices in low-power states, utilizing Overlaid On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation combined with OFDM sequences. This design allows for the transmission of more information per symbol, enhancing the coverage and robustness against interference (R1-2400123, p. 2).
   - The LP-WUR is expected to operate effectively in both IDLE/INACTIVE and CONNECTED modes, ensuring that the same information is delivered irrespective of the type of wake-up receiver (R1-2400123, p. 3).

2. **Measurement Metrics**:
   - The proposals include the introduction of LP-RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power) and LP-RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality) as metrics for RRM (Radio Resource Management) serving cell measurements, which are essential for the LP-WUS monitoring entry and exit conditions (R1-2407041, p. 7).

3. **Wake-Up Mechanisms**:
   - Various wake-up mechanisms are proposed, including direct activation of PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) monitoring and the use of DRX (Discontinuous Reception) configurations. The direct wake-up of search space monitoring is considered the most straightforward approach, avoiding the complexities associated with DRX configurations (R1-2400592, p. 2).
   - The LP-WUS should interwork with legacy power-saving schemes, ensuring that the wake-up signal can trigger necessary actions without introducing additional overhead (R1-2402339, p. 2).

4. **Operational Considerations**:
   - The LP-WUS design aims to support a duty-cycled monitoring approach, which is crucial for devices that operate under strict power constraints. The ability to terminate LP-WUS reception early for OFDM-based receivers offers significant power savings (R1-2400123, p. 3).
   - The proposals also emphasize the need for flexibility in activation and deactivation of LP-WUS monitoring based on various conditions, including gNB signaling and pre-configured timers (R1-2402339, p. 2).

### Conclusion:
The development of LP-WUS and LP-WUR is a significant advancement in optimizing power consumption for mobile devices, particularly in scenarios where devices frequently transition between active and low-power states. The integration of these signals into existing frameworks, along with the proposed measurement metrics and operational strategies, aims to enhance the overall efficiency of NR (New Radio) networks. The ongoing discussions and proposals reflect a collaborative effort to refine these concepts within the 3GPP framework."
