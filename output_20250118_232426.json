The document details various agreements reached in previous meetings regarding the evaluation of temporal domain aspects of AI/ML-based CSI compression, including categorization for study, baseline options for UE distribution, and evaluation assumptions. It also presents results from simulations using different model architectures, highlighting the performance gains achieved through the use of past samples in the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the document discusses inter-vendor collaboration options, emphasizing the need for standardized signaling for parameter and dataset exchanges. The conclusions summarize observations and proposals for future directions in the study of AI/ML for CSI compression.",
